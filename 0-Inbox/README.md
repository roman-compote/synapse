# 0-Inbox - Quick Capture Landing Zone

## Purpose

The Inbox is your **frictionless capture zone** for all incoming information. This is where everything lands before being processed, organized, and moved to its permanent home.

**Key Principle:** Capture fast, process later. Low friction = more content captured.

---

## What Goes Here

### Web Clips (web-clips/)
- Articles clipped via Obsidian Web Clipper
- Blog posts and tutorials
- Documentation pages
- Any web content worth saving

### Bookmarks (bookmarks/)
- Browser bookmarks to process
- Links to resources
- URLs to review later

### Videos (videos/)
- YouTube videos to watch
- Conference talks
- Tutorial videos
- Lecture recordings

### Quick Notes (quick-notes/)
- Fleeting ideas and thoughts
- Meeting notes to process
- Temporary reminders
- Random insights

---

## Guidelines

**DO:**
- ✅ Save everything worth keeping without overthinking
- ✅ Add minimal metadata (just enough to remember why it's important)
- ✅ Use appropriate subfolder (web-clips, bookmarks, videos, quick-notes)
- ✅ Trust the weekly review process

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Spend time organizing or linking (do that during review)
- ❌ Worry about perfect categorization
- ❌ Let perfectionism block capture
- ❌ Let Inbox grow beyond 50 unprocessed items

---

## Processing Workflow

### Daily Capture (5-10 min)
- See something interesting → Save to appropriate Inbox subfolder
- Quick idea → Create quick note
- No deep processing, just capture

### Weekly Review (Every Friday/Sunday)
**Goal: Empty or <10 items**

For each item:
1. **Read/review** the content
2. **Extract** key points and insights
3. **Add** proper tags and metadata
4. **Link** to 3+ related notes
5. **Move** to permanent location:
   - Articles → `3-Resources/articles/`
   - Bookmarks → `3-Resources/bookmarks/`
   - Videos → `3-Resources/videos/`
   - Quick notes → Expand into permanent note or incorporate into existing note
6. **Delete** if no longer relevant

See [[5-Meta/Guidelines/Processing-Workflow]] for detailed instructions.

**Remember:** The best system is one you actually use. Capture liberally, process regularly, perfect rarely.
