# 2-Areas - Ongoing Responsibilities & Interests

## Purpose

Areas are **ongoing spheres of activity** with no end date. They represent responsibilities, interests, or aspects of your work/life that require continuous attention and maintenance.

**Key Principle:** If it's ongoing and has no defined end date, it's an area.

---

## What Goes Here

### Examples of Areas:
- **AI/LLM Learning** - Continuous education and skill development
- **Workshop Planning** - Ongoing teaching and workshop delivery
- **Knowledge Management** - Maintaining this vault
- **Professional Development** - Career growth and networking
- **Research** - Ongoing exploration of AI topics
- **Tool Evaluation** - Staying current with new tools and frameworks

### What's NOT an Area:
- Time-bound work → Those are [[1-Projects/README|Projects]]
- Reference material → Goes in [[3-Resources/README|3-Resources]]
- One-time tasks → Those are project tasks

---

## Structure

Each area should have:
```
2-Areas/
└── Area-Name/
    ├── Area-Overview.md (using area template)
    ├── related-notes.md
    ├── resources.md
    └── current-focus.md
```

Or simply:
```
2-Areas/
└── Area-Name.md (simpler approach)
```

## Guidelines

**Creating an Area:**
1. Use the area template: `5-Meta/Templates/area-template.md`
2. Define the purpose and why this area matters
3. Set standards (what "good" looks like)
4. Identify current focus
5. Link to related projects and resources
6. Set review schedule (weekly, monthly, quarterly)

**Managing an Area:**
- Areas don't get "completed" - they get maintained
- Review regularly according to schedule
- Projects often emerge from areas
- Link related projects back to their parent area
- Update standards and focus as they evolve

**Archiving an Area:**
- If an area is no longer relevant, move to `4-Archives/areas/`
- Document why it was archived
- Keep links for historical context

## Active Areas

**Current Areas:** [List active areas here or use dataview query]

Example structure:
- AI/LLM Learning
- Workshop Planning & Teaching
- Knowledge Base Management
- Professional Development

## Area vs Project

| Aspect | Area | Project |
|--------|------|---------|
| **Duration** | Ongoing, no end date | Finite, has deadline |
| **Goal** | Maintain a standard | Achieve specific outcome |
| **Example** | AI Learning | Complete RAG course by March |
| **Status** | Active or Inactive | In Progress or Complete |
| **Review** | Regular maintenance | Track to completion |

**Relationship:** Projects often serve Areas
- Area: "AI/LLM Learning"
  - Project: "Master prompt engineering"
  - Project: "Build RAG application"
  - Project: "Complete LangChain tutorial"

---

## Review Schedule

**Weekly:**
- Quick check-in on active areas
- Identify what needs attention this week
- Link any new projects to their parent area

**Monthly:**
- Thorough review of each area
- Update standards and current focus
- Assess if area is still relevant
- Create new projects to support area goals

**Quarterly:**
- Deep review of all areas
- Archive inactive areas
- Adjust priorities
- Plan next quarter's focus

**Remember:** Areas are the responsibilities and interests that define your work. Projects are the specific initiatives that move areas forward.
