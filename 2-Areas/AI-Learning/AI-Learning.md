# AI/LLM Learning

## Purpose

Continuous education and skill development in AI/LLM engineering. This area encompasses staying current with the latest AI developments, deepening technical expertise, and building practical skills through hands-on projects and exercises.

**Why this matters:** AI/LLM technology evolves rapidly. Sustained learning and experimentation are essential for staying effective and building valuable expertise in this field.

---

## Standards

What "good" looks like in this area:

- **Stay Current:** Aware of major model releases, technique innovations, and tool updates within 1-2 weeks
- **Deep Understanding:** Not just knowing what works, but understanding why and when to apply different approaches
- **Practical Skills:** Can implement concepts learned through exercises and real projects
- **Share Knowledge:** Document learnings for future reference and to teach others
- **Balanced Learning:** Mix of theoretical understanding, hands-on practice, and staying current with news

**Success Indicators:**
- Completing 1-2 substantive exercises per month
- Publishing 2-3 new permanent notes per week on concepts learned
- Staying current with major AI developments (weekly review of news)
- Successfully applying new techniques in projects or workshops
- Knowledge base grows in breadth and depth

## Current Focus

### This Month (December 2025)
- Implement knowledge base reorganization (PARA + Zettelkasten)
- Process existing bookmarks and resources into structured notes
- Strengthen understanding of RAG implementations
- Explore latest prompt engineering techniques

### This Quarter (Q1 2026)
- Master agent frameworks (LangChain, CrewAI, or similar)
- Deep dive into retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) best practices
- Build 2-3 practical AI applications from scratch
- Update all model documentation with latest releases

## Notes

**Insights & Reflections:**

*2025-12-23:* Starting knowledge base reorganization with PARA method. Excited to see how this improves discoverability and learning retention. The combination of PARA (organization) + Zettelkasten (linking) should create powerful network effects.

**Learning Observations:**
- Best learning happens when theory (reading/videos) is immediately followed by practice (exercises)
- Teaching concepts to others (or documenting them clearly) solidifies understanding
- Regular review and linking of notes creates unexpected connections and insights

**Areas to Explore:**
- Advanced RAG techniques (hybrid search, re-ranking, query expansion)
- Multi-modal AI applications
- Fine-tuning and model customization
- Production deployment best practices
- AI safety and alignment considerations
