## Decision Log

As questions are answered and decisions made, document them here.

### Decision Template

```markdown
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Question:** [Question from above]
**Decision:** [What was decided]
**Rationale:** [Why this decision]
**Next Steps:** [Actions to take]
```

---

### Decision 1: Time Availability

**Date:** 2025-12-23
**Question:** How much time can you realistically dedicate to knowledge base maintenance?
**Decision:** Moderate commitment - 3-4 hours per week total
**Rationale:** Balanced approach that's sustainable long-term. Allows for:
- Daily: 10 min maintenance
- Weekly: 2-hour review sessions
- Monthly: 3-hour deep reviews
- Quarterly: 4-5 hours strategic review

This matches the plan's "Standard" recommendation and is realistic for ongoing maintenance without burnout.

**Next Steps:**
- Use standard workflow timings from plan (not light/intensive variants)
- Schedule weekly 2-hour review block (Friday afternoon or Sunday morning)
- Set calendar reminders for all review cycles

---

### Decision 2: Content Backlog Size

**Date:** 2025-12-23
**Question:** What's the current state of your bookmarks and content backlog?
**Decision:** Light backlog - Less than 100 bookmarks, less than 20 open tabs
**Rationale:** Manageable size that can be processed within 2-3 weeks during Phase 2. No need for "bookmark bankruptcy" approach.

**Next Steps:**
- Use standard bookmark processing workflow (no shortcuts needed)
- Allocate 3-4 hours total for backlog processing in Phase 2
- Process 20-30 bookmarks per session (2-3 sessions total)
- Can afford to be thorough rather than selective

---

### Decision 3: Primary Use Cases

**Date:** 2025-12-23
**Question:** What are your top 3 use cases for this knowledge base?
**Decision:**
1. Personal learning and AI/LLM skill development (Primary)
2. Team knowledge sharing and collaboration (Secondary)
3. Quick reference and documentation lookup (Tertiary)

**Rationale:**
- Personal learning is the foundation - need solid individual system first
- Team sharing is important and wanted from the start
- Quick reference ensures practical daily value

**Next Steps:**
- Optimize for personal learning workflow first (Phases 1-2)
- Build collaboration features during implementation (not after)
- Ensure fast search/lookup capabilities (use Obsidian quick switcher, bookmarks)
- Create clear, well-linked notes for easy reference

---

### Decision 4: Collaboration Timeline

**Date:** 2025-12-23
**Question:** When do you plan to start sharing with colleagues?
**Decision:** Immediately / During implementation
**Rationale:** Want to build with collaboration in mind from day 1. This ensures structure and standards work for team use, not just personal.

**Next Steps:**
- **CRITICAL:** Prioritize collaboration features earlier than plan suggests
- Create Contribution Guidelines during Phase 1 (not Phase 4)
- Create simple Onboarding Guide during Phase 2
- Share early version with 1-2 colleagues by end of Phase 2 for feedback
- Set up Git workflow immediately (already using Git)
- Document decisions and standards clearly from the start
- Keep quality high from beginning (others will see it)

**Impact on Plan:**
- Move collaboration prep tasks from Phase 4 to Phases 1-2
- Higher priority on documentation quality
- Need clear README and navigation from start

---

### Decision 5: Content Type Priorities

**Date:** 2025-12-23
**Question:** Which content types are most important to organize first?
**Decision:** All types are important (in order):
1. Web articles and technical blog posts
2. YouTube videos and online courses
3. Research papers and academic content
4. Code examples and GitHub repositories

**Rationale:** Comprehensive AI knowledge base needs all content types well-organized.

**Next Steps:**
- Create templates for ALL content types in Phase 1 (Task 1.4):
  - Article template (web clips)
  - Video template
  - Research paper template
  - Code example template
- Test each template with 1-2 examples during Phase 1
- During Phase 2 processing, handle all content types (not just bookmarks)
- Create separate folders in 3-Resources/ for each type

---

### Decision 6: Risk Tolerance and Tool Complexity

**Date:** 2025-12-23
**Question:** What's your approach to complexity and experimentation?
**Decision:** Conservative - Start simple, proven approaches
**Rationale:** Prefer stability and sustainability over cutting-edge features. Want system that works reliably.

**Next Steps:**
- **Simplify plugin recommendations:**
  - Phase 1: Core plugins only (Templates, Backlinks, Web Clipper)
  - Phase 2: Add only Daily Notes if useful
  - Phase 3+: Consider Dataview only if there's a clear need
  - Defer: Tasks, Calendar, Templater, Tag Wrangler (add only if pain point emerges)

- **Simplify workflows:**
  - Start with basic templates (no complex Templater scripts)
  - Use simple frontmatter (don't over-engineer)
  - Manual processing fine (automation can wait)

- **Defer advanced features:**
  - Skip Zettelkasten IDs (use wiki-links only)
  - Skip advanced automation (Zapier, scripts)
  - Skip AI integration initially (add in Phase 3+ if interested)

**Impact on Plan:**
- Significantly reduce plugin count in Phase 1
- Focus on core workflow: Capture → Process → Link
- Add complexity only when clear need emerges

---

### Decision 7: Folder Numbering

**Date:** 2025-12-23
**Question:** Use numbered folders (0-Inbox, 1-Projects) or not?
**Decision:** To be evaluated after Week 1-2 trial
**Rationale:** Will test during Phase 1 and decide based on personal preference.

**Next Steps:**
- Implement with numbers as planned
- After 1-2 weeks, assess: helpful or annoying?
- Can easily rename if not working
- Document final decision here after trial

---
