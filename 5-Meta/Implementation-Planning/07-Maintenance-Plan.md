# Maintenance Plan - Sustaining Your Knowledge Base

Comprehensive maintenance schedules, review processes, and quality standards to keep your knowledge base healthy and valuable long-term.

---

## Maintenance Philosophy

### Core Principles

**1. Systems Beat Motivation**
- Don't rely on feeling motivated
- Build habits and routines
- Use calendar reminders
- Make it easy to maintain

**2. Little and Often > Big and Rare**
- 30 min daily better than 4 hours monthly (but do both!)
- Consistent small efforts compound
- Prevents overwhelming backlogs

**3. Quality Over Quantity**
- Better to have 100 well-maintained notes
- Than 1000 abandoned notes
- Focus on value, not volume

**4. Continuous Improvement**
- Review and refine processes
- Adapt based on what works
- No process is final

---

## Daily Maintenance (10-15 minutes)

### Morning Routine (5 minutes)

For each high-priority item:

**Articles/Web Clips:**
1. Read or skim (5-10 min)
2. Extract 5-10 key points

## Troubleshooting Maintenance

### Common Problems

**"I'm falling behind on reviews"**
- Reduce frequency (bi-weekly instead of weekly)
- Reduce scope (shorter reviews)
- Batch process less frequently
- Capture less content
- Lower perfectionism standards

**"Reviews feel like a chore"**
- Make environment enjoyable (music, good light)
- Shorter time blocks
- Focus on value, not obligation
- Skip non-essential parts
- Reward yourself after

**"I don't see the benefit"**
- Track specific wins (found info quickly, made connection)
- Measure vault health improvement
- Notice reduced stress from organization
- May need to give it more time (3+ months)

**"System is too complex"**
- Simplify! Drop optional parts
- Focus on core: Capture and Weekly Review
- Skip monthly/quarterly initially
- Add complexity only when needed

---

## Success Metrics
