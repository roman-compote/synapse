# AI Knowledge Base - Implementation Plan

> **📋 Note:** This is **historical implementation documentation** that guided the initial creation of this knowledge base. It represents the planning, research, and decision-making process used to design the vault structure and workflows.
>
> **For current vault usage,** refer to:
> - [[../Guidelines/Knowledge-Base-Guidelines|Knowledge Base Guidelines]] - Current content standards
> - [[../Guidelines/Processing-Workflow|Processing Workflow]] - Active workflows
> - [[../../README|Main README]] - Primary navigation hub
>
> **Educational Value:** This documentation demonstrates best practices for planning a knowledge management system and may be useful for others building similar systems.
