## 💡 Remember

**Start Simple:**
- Don't try to implement everything at once
- Focus on core workflow: Capture → Process → Link
- Add complexity only when you hit a clear pain point

**Evaluate Often:**
- Check in after each phase
- Adjust if something's not working
- It's okay to simplify or change direction

**Progress Over Perfection:**
- A simple system you actually use > perfect system you don't
- Consistency beats intensity
- Build habits gradually

**Your Plan, Your Pace:**
- Timeline estimates are guidelines, not deadlines
- Slower is fine if it's sustainable
- Quality of implementation > speed of completion
