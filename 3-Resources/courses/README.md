# Online Courses - AI/LLM Engineering

Structured courses completed or in-progress for learning AI/LLM development, coding assistants, agent systems, and related technologies.

---

## Purpose

This directory contains **comprehensive notes from online courses** you've taken. Unlike videos (which are typically shorter content pieces), courses represent substantial learning investments with structured curricula.

**What to Capture:**
- Key learnings and concepts
- Practical takeaways and patterns
- Tools and technologies covered
- Your assessment and recommendations
- Links to related vault concepts
- Action items for future implementation

## Organization Guidelines

### File Naming
- Use descriptive, searchable names
- Format: `Course-Title-Platform.md` or `Course-Title.md`
- Example: `AI-Engineer-Agentic-Track.md`

### Using the Template
1. Use [[5-Meta/Templates/course-template|course template]] for consistency
2. Fill in all metadata (platform, instructor, URL, dates)
3. Focus on **what you learned**, not just what was taught
4. Link to at least 3-5 related concepts in your vault
5. Include practical takeaways you can apply

### Processing Workflow

**For Courses Just Discovered (Not Yet Started):**
1. Capture to `0-Inbox/bookmarks/` or `0-Inbox/web-clips/`
2. During weekly review, decide whether to:
   - Start the course (create Project in `1-Projects/`)
   - Add to course wishlist in your notes
   - Archive/delete if no longer relevant

**For Courses In Progress:**
1. Create a **Project** in `1-Projects/Course-[Name]/`
2. Track progress and learnings there
3. Link to this resource note for reference

**For Completed Courses:**
1. Use course template to create permanent note here
2. Extract key learnings, patterns, and takeaways
3. Archive the project to `4-Archives/projects/[year]/`
4. Update relevant MOCs with new insights

## Integration with Vault

### Linking Strategy

Completed course notes should link to:
- **Concepts in `3-Resources/`** - Deep dives on topics covered
- **Tools in `3-Resources/tools/`** - Technologies used
- **Exercises in `3-Resources/exercises/`** - Related practice
- **MOCs in `5-Meta/MOCs/`** - Topic navigation hubs

### Updating Existing Content

When you complete a course:
1. Review existing notes on topics it covered
2. Update those notes with new insights
3. Cross-reference course in related concept notes
4. Update MOCs to include course perspective

## Quality Standards

### What Makes a Good Course Note

**Essential Elements:**
- Complete metadata (platform, dates, status)
- Clear summary of what you learned
- Practical patterns/techniques you can apply
- Well-organized structure
- Links to 3+ related vault concepts
- Honest assessment and recommendation

**Going Further:**
- Code snippets of key patterns
- Comparison with other approaches
- Critical analysis (what could be better)
- Action items you completed or plan to
- Resources mentioned you've explored

### Avoid These Pitfalls

- ❌ Just copying course outline without insights
- ❌ No links to related concepts
- ❌ Vague or generic takeaways
- ❌ Missing metadata (dates, platform, instructor)
- ❌ Not updating related notes with new knowledge

## Tips for Course Notes

**1. Capture Early, Refine Later**
- Start note when you begin the course
- Add learnings as you progress
- Finalize when complete

**2. Focus on Application**
- Not just "what did they teach"
- But "what can I do with this"
- Concrete patterns and examples

**3. Connect to Existing Knowledge**
- How does this relate to what you already know?
- What gaps does it fill?
- What questions does it raise?

**4. Be Honest in Assessment**
- What worked well?
- What could be better?
- Who should (and shouldn't) take this?

**5. Extract Action Items**
- What will you implement?
- What will you practice?
- What will you explore further?
