# GPT-5

OpenAI's latest unified AI model released in August 2025, combining the reasoning abilities of o-series models with fast responses. Described as "our smartest, fastest, most useful model yet, with built-in thinking."

## Key Features
- **Unified Architecture**: Combines reasoning and fast response capabilities
- **Built-in Thinking**: Internal chain of thought reasoning available to all users
- **Multimodal**: Advanced text, vision, and reasoning capabilities
- **Variable Reasoning**: Four reasoning levels (minimal, low, medium, high)
- **Cost Efficient**: 60x cheaper input, 15x cheaper output vs GPT-4

## Performance Highlights
- **Math**: 94.6% on AIME 2025 without tools
- **Coding**: 74.9% on SWE-bench Verified, 88% on Aider Polyglot  
- **Multimodal**: 84.2% on MMMU
- **Factual Accuracy**: 45% fewer errors than GPT-4o (80% with thinking)
- **Expert Level**: Comparable to experts in ~50% of cases across 40+ occupations

## Model Variants
- **GPT-5**: Standard unified model
- **GPT-5 Mini**: Smaller, efficient version
- **GPT-5 Nano**: Compact variant for resource-constrained use

## Reasoning Capabilities
- **Four Levels**: Minimal, low, medium, high reasoning intensity
- **Visible Thinking**: Chain of thought exposed to users
- **First Free Reasoning**: First reasoning model available to free users
- **Better than o3**: 50-80% fewer output tokens for similar performance

## API Pricing
- **Input**: $1.25 per million tokens
- **Output**: $10 per million tokens
- **Reasoning Levels**: Variable pricing based on reasoning intensity

## Use Cases
