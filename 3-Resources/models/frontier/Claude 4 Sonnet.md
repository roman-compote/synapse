# Claude 4 Sonnet

Anthropic's advanced model released in May 2025, balancing performance and efficiency with hybrid reasoning capabilities. Excels in coding with state-of-the-art performance.

## Key Features
- **Hybrid Reasoning**: Two modes - instant responses or extended thinking
- **Massive Context**: 1 million tokens (5x increase from 3.5)
- **Coding Excellence**: 72.7% on SWE-bench benchmark
- **Extended Thinking**: Visible step-by-step reasoning
- **Enhanced Steerability**: Better control over model behavior

## Performance Highlights
- **SWE-bench**: 72.7% (state-of-the-art coding)
- **Context Processing**: 75,000+ lines of code in single request
- **Multi-file Understanding**: Complex codebase analysis
- **Real-world Tasks**: Sustained performance over hours
- **Balanced Efficiency**: Optimal capability-to-cost ratio

## Hybrid Architecture
- **Instant Mode**: Near-instantaneous responses
- **Thinking Mode**: Extended reasoning with visible thought process
- **API Control**: Fine-grained control over thinking duration
- **User Choice**: Switch between speed and depth

## Context Capabilities
- **1M Tokens**: Process entire codebases
- **Research Papers**: Analyze dozens simultaneously  
- **Complex Projects**: Handle large-scale software projects
- **Memory Efficiency**: Optimized for large context processing

## Industry Adoption
