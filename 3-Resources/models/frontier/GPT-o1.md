# GPT-o1

OpenAI's reasoning-focused model designed specifically for complex problem-solving tasks. Uses reinforcement learning to "think" through problems step-by-step before responding.

## Key Features
- **Reasoning-First**: Explicit reasoning process before answering
- **Problem Solving**: Optimized for math, science, and coding
- **Step-by-Step**: Shows work and thought process
- **Accuracy**: Higher accuracy on complex tasks
- **Specialized**: Focused on reasoning over general conversation

## Capabilities
- Advanced mathematical problem solving
- Scientific reasoning and analysis
- Complex coding challenges
- Multi-step logical problems
- Academic research assistance
- Competition-level problem solving

## Reasoning Process
- Takes time to "think" before responding
- Shows chain of thought
- Self-corrects mistakes
- Explores multiple approaches
- Validates solutions

## Use Cases
- Mathematical competitions and olympiads
- Scientific research problems
- Complex coding challenges
- Academic problem solving
- Engineering design problems
- Strategy and planning tasks

## Performance
- PhD-level performance on many academic benchmarks
- Exceptional on mathematical reasoning
- Strong on coding competitions
- High accuracy on multi-step problems
- Slower but more accurate than GPT-4

## API Access
- Available through OpenAI API
- Higher cost due to reasoning compute
- Rate limits for reasoning-intensive tasks
- Preview access initially

## Limitations
- Slower response times
- Higher computational cost
