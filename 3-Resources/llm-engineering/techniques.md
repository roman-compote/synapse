Summary of techniques
- APIs - Interfaces to connect LLMs with software systems, external services, or data sources.
- multi-shot prompting - Providing several examples in the prompt to guide the model toward consistent responses.
- [[RAG]] - **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** - Supplying relevant external documents to the model at query time, improving factual accuracy.
- [[agents - agentisation]] - Architectures where LLMs plan, decide, and call tools iteratively to achieve multi-step goals.
- fine-tuning - Training the base model on domain-specific data to specialize it for tasks (customer support, legal, medical).
