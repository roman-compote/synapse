- OpenSource framework launched in October 2022
- provides a common framework for interfacing with many LLMs
- includes its own declarative language: LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) - also python can be used
- greatly simplifies the creation of application using LLMs (eg AI assistants, RAG, summarization) - fast time to market
- wrapper code around LLMs makes it easy to swap models
- as APIs for LLMs have matured, converged and simplified, the need for a unifying framework like LangChain has decreased
